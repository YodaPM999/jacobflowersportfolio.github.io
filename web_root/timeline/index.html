Max Scherzer pulled off one of the rarest feats in MLB history by striking out 20 opposing batters in a single game on May 11th. He also took home the first Cy Young award in Nationals history. The offense featured a lot of star talent, newly signed free agent Daniel Murphy leading the way with a 2nd place MVP finish. Rookie Trea Turner also makes his debut and shows flashes of being a potential superstar in the final months of the season. The Nationals fail to advance in the postseason once again, this time falling to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 5 games.</p>

                    <p>The pressure of Bryce Harper’s impending free agency proved to be too much for the Nationals as they finished 2nd in the division with a measly 82-80 record. A lot of players regressed from the previous year and ended up being traded away at the deadline. One bright spot in this meltdown of a season was the emergence of Juan Soto, a new young superstar for the Nationals who finished 2nd in NL Rookie Of the Year voting.</p>

                    <p>This season could not have gotten off with a worse start. 50 games in, the Nationals sat at the bottom of their division with a 19-31 record. Rumors of a fire sale began to emerge and fans were calling for the manager to be fired. Just when the team hit rock bottom, they managed to right the ship, going 74-38 the rest of the way and managing to squeeze their way into the playoffs with a 93-69 record. Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto were the dominant bats that led the way, backed by a strong supporting cast that refused to quit no matter how dire the situation looked. Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg, and newly signed free agents Patrick Corbin and Anibal Sanchez came together to form one of the best starting rotations in the league. The Nationals rode this momentum throughout the rest of the postseason, taking out one juggernaut team after another, en route to their 1st ever World Series victory.</p>
