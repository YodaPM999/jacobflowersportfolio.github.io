        <h1>Design Rationale</h1>
        <section>
            <p>
                <strong>How did you approach choosing content for the site?</strong><br>
                I thought it would be fun to embrace the childlike nature of my audience by stylizing the planets as if they were animated characters. I gave them all fun facial expressions that showcase their unique personalities.
                <strong>How have you considered the age of your audience in your process and final design?</strong><br>
                Well, for starters, the theme of the content was specifically catered to a younger audience like I mentioned before. I also wanted to make the site relatively easy to navigate, with a simple layout and not too much content on the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Describe the two moods you developed in your mood boards. How did differentiate them from one another?</strong><br>
                My first mood board was titled "Crafty", and the goal for this one was to give the page a handmade style, almost as if a child drew everything with crayons. My second mood board was titled "Illuminated", and this one pute emphasis on making things glow. Nearly everything from the planets to the stars in the background had a glowing effect. Even the color palette was specifically chosen to make the text look like it was lit up.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How did you approach working on the style tile? Do you feel that your style tile adequately communicates the design of your website to a potential client?</strong><br>
                For my style tile, I didn't really have a whole lot of plans for the technical things such as grids and navigation bars, and I think it shows in my final design. I was able to convey the overall mood and feel, but the look of the site differs quite a bit from some of the content showcased in the style tile. Since the illuminated visual theme of the design was such a big part of the site, I think I can get away with it, but in the future, I think I can do a better job of making my style tile feel less like a mood board.

            <p>
                <strong>How have you used color?</strong><br>
                Color is used to show strong contrast throughout the design. The bright colored text and stars really pop out against the dark outer space background. The planets are all a unique color as well, giving them their own unique identity and making them stand out as the focal point of the site. The glowing effects enhance the contrast even further, as a lot of elements in the page look like they could be night lights.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Which Google fonts did you use and why?</strong><br>
                I used Rowdies for the headers for two reasons. The first was that it felt really bold, and, when paired with the bright green color, would result in type that is easy to read despite being reversed out. Something about it also felt very "sci-fi" to me, which I though was appropriate for my theme. I used Arimo for the body copy because the "neutral" look of the letters paired nicely with the bold, stylized Rowdies.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Did you validate your HTML and CSS? What were the results?</strong><br>
                Yes, and I got some interesting results. The HTML was fine outside of a couple errors that needed to be fixed, but the CSS kept giving an error about my column-width. It states that 13.5% isn't a valid measurement, but it seems to work fine? I decided to leave it for now, but I thought it was strange that percentages are supposedly invalid, yet it seemed to space them out without any issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How have you included simple animations or transitions?</strong><br>
                The planets and the alien have a very simple bobbing animation where they move slightly up, then back down to their starting position in an infinite loop. I also included a hover transition that plays whenever the user hovers over one of the buttons on the navigation bar.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Where did your images come from and how have you credited them?</strong><br>
                The one image I got from another source came from a user on Freepik, and I made sure to follow their attribution rules for free downloads. The rest was made by me, and I gave myself some well deserved credit for making all those planets because it took a lot of fine tuning to get their sizes just right.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Describe your overall objective in terms of design. What did you seek to convey?</strong><br>
                Knowing my target audience, I wanted to make a webpage design that felt fun to navigate through while also providing some useful knowledge as an educational site. I remember when I was that age, all of my favorite educational sites were the ones that embraced the silliness, but not to the point where it was a distraction. I also wanted the site to feel "alive", almost as if you were actually in space and the planets were living characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How did formal design elements help you realize your composition (scale, balance, hierarchy, positive and negative space, etc.)? Be specific.</strong><br>
                Negative space probably played the biggest part in the overall layout of the design. Since the site takes place in outer space, I wanted there to be a sense of emptiness. At the same time, the planets had to be big enough to make a prominent impact on the page, so I had to find that balance of not too much, but not too little. Hierarchy also played a big role, as I had to make sure to balance the size and placement of the text and the planets to make sure the planets stood out, but didn't completely overpower everything else. I also had to find the right size for the alien that guides the viewer
                throughout the journey. I had to make sure he didn't steal the show by being too big or being placed closer to the center of the screen.

                <strong>What, if anything, are you especially proud of accomplishing for this assignment?</strong><br>
                The overall style and creative vision of the site. I had a clear goal in mind, and it shows in the final project. Obviously, the custom made planets are my favorite part, but I'm especially proud of myself for being able to tie everything else in and make it all feel cohesive.
