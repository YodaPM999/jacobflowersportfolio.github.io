                    <p> 
                        My name is Jacob Flowers, and I have been taking classes here at <a href="https://www.tcc.edu/">TCC<span><img src="assets/css/coin.gif" alt="coin" width="20" height="20"></span></a> for a little over a year now. Growing up, I always had a wild imagination, and this was evident in my hobbies, ranging from drawing, to painting, to video game creation, to writing my own stories. Pretty much everything I did for fun involved me getting my creative juices flowing. Once I hit my high school years, I slowly started to abandon physical media and gravitated more to digital media. My artistic ability with a pencil just could not keep up with what I would envision in my head, so I searched for other ways to create art.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="hover-img">
                    <p>During the Covid lockdown in 2020, me and my mother found a website called Outschool, which had a wide variety of elective classes that students of all ages could sign up for. They were small, and would only last for like a month or so, we figured it would be a good way to explore some of my interests. Around summertime, I took a class that introduced me to a neat little software called Photoshop. Initially, it was a bit overwhelming, but I quickly learned the basics and was soon having a blast doing all sorts of crazy things to photos. A few months later, I was searching for potential jobs for my future. I then stumbled upon Graphic Design. Wait, you're telling me I could use software similar to Photoshop for a living? AND make decent money doing so? At the age of 16, I decided right there and then that I wanted to be a Graphic Design major.</p>
                    <p>Fast forward to now, and I do not regret my decision at all. My time here at TCC's <a href="https://www.tcc.edu/come-to-tcc/norfolk-campus/visual-arts-center/">Visual Arts Center<span><img src="assets/css/coin.gif" alt="coin" width="20" height="20"></span></a> has had it's share of ups and downs, but I feel like I have grown so much as a designer in such a short amount of time.</p>
                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <p>My main goal as of right now is to buckle down and get good grades for the rest of my classes so I can graduate with my Associates Degree in the spring. After that... well I'm still undecided. I'm not sure if I should attempt to transfer and get a Bachelors Degree, or if I should dive straight into the workforce and apply for a job. That's another thing: I'm not 100% sure on what exactly it is that I want to do in the Graphic Design field. I enjoy pretty much everything. Whether it's logo creation, designing posters and book covers, clothing design, or whatever else, I have fun doing all of it. Even animation has begun to grow on me over the past few weeks as I've learned how to use Adobe After Effects. I guess it gives me a lot of options for my future, but that is both a blessing and a curse as it leaves me feeling a bit lost on where to go next. At some point, I need to sit down and really narrow down what exactly I want to do next. The spring will be here before I know it, there's not a whole lot of time left.</p>
                    <p>During my time as an artist and as a designer, I have definitely been inspired by various creators and their artstyles. As recently as last year, I've learned about <a href="https://thelogocreative.medium.com/aaron-draplin-logo-design-the-draplin-way-1f3b6e9cce85">Aaron Draplin<span><img src="assets/css/coin.gif" alt="coin" width="20" height="20"></span></a> and was not only impressed with his work, but also his approach to the design process as a whole. I would definitely love to meet him someday and pick his brain to learn some things. Another person who I have admired for the longest time without even knowing it is a man named <a href="https://medium.com/super-jump/bringing-super-mario-to-life-49b85c3b7f01">Yoichi Kotabe<span><img src="assets/css/coin.gif" alt="coin" width="20" height="20"></span></a>, a character designer who animated and illustrated artwork for various companies, including Nintendo. As somebody who grew up playing a lot of Mario games, I was often influenced by the cartoony style of these games and would try to replicate that style in my own works. As I've grown older, I have tried to branch out and experiment with different styles, but his influence still can be found in some of my artwork even to this day.</p>
