                    <h2>Mario Kart: Double Dash!! (2003)</h2>
                    <p>The Mario Kart franchise is currently one of Nintendo's most popular franchises, and for good reason. For 30 years, this series has entertained millions of gamers with its refined controls, zany powerups, dynamic race courses, and colorful cast of iconic characters. Of the 9 entries, I find myself going back to this GameCube classic the most. The gimmick of having two racers control one kart added a whole new layer of fun to the series' already fantastic kart racer formula. Each character also had their own unique powerup, which gave the player a reason to try out each one and see which powerup fit with their playstyle the best. This combined with the two driver mechanic gave the player the ability to mix and match character combinations, adding a unique strategy that no other game in the series has come close to matching in my opinion.</p>
                    <p>Even when you ignore all the fancy gimmicks, Double Dash!! still has everything you'd want in a Mario Kart game. There is a certain charm to the simplistic, vibrant art direction that this game has that gives both it's characters and their environments a lot of life. It screams "Mario", and I love it. While it features a small number of just 16 tracks, each one is super fun to play and is geared to the games chaotic vibe. There may not be a large quantity, but there is certainly a level of quality that makes it so replaying these levels never get old. When it's all said and done, even though the series may objectively improve with each new entry, there are so many special things about Mario Kart: Double Dash!! that make this one of my all time favorite video games.</p>

                    <h2>The Sims 3 (2009)</h2>
                    <p>This day-to-day life simulation has a basic premise: live your life howwever you damn well please. OK, there's a little more to the game than that, but I think that once sentence sumarizes the game quite well. You take control of up to 8 "sims" that are completely customizable from their looks, to their outfits, and even their individual personality traits. Want to put yourself in the game and attempt to live your dream life? You sure can. Maybe you are a writer who wants to group a bunch of OCs in a house together? That is entirely possible! Or perhaps you want to make the ugliest abomination known to mankind with the worst personality traits the game has to offer and watch them suffer? Well, there's nothing stopping you, so go right ahead!</p>
                    <p>What makes The Sims 3 a standout entry for me is the sheer amount of content the game has to offer. There are plenty of jobs for you to get, ranging from the basics, such as Doctors and Law Inforcers, all the way to some wacky professions such as working as a Criminal or a Fortune Teller. Where the game truly shines though is when sims interact with one another. Again, there are a lot of options available to the player. You can talk about a wide variety of topics such as books, TV shows, how your day is going, so on. However, the personality traits of your sims will come into play during these interactions, creating some hilarious scenarios. For example, a sim with the Hot-Headed trait will be prone to getting angry fast and picking fights with other sims. Meanwhile, Flirty sims will start hitting on random strangers before you have the chance to stop them. While all games in The Sims series utilize this mechanic in some way, I feel like it was executed the best in The Sims 3 with the large selection of personality traits and interactions to choose from. This entry is far from perfect. It is filled with bugs and glitches making it a pain to play on some occassions. However, the core game is so good that I'm willing to put up with all of it's faults. It's the perfect game for me to just relax and play for hours on end without a care in the world. </p>
