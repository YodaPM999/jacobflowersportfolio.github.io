                    <h2>Mario Kart: Double Dash!! (2003)</h2>
                    <p>The Mario Kart franchise is currently one of Nintendo's most popular franchises, and for good reason. For 30 years, this series has entertained millions of gamers with its refined controls, zany powerups, dynamic race courses, and colorful cast of iconic characters. Of the 9 entries, I find myself going back to this GameCube classic the most. The gimmick of having two racers control one kart added a whole new layer of fun to the series' already fantastic kart racer formula. Each character also had their own unique powerup, which gave the player a reason to try out each one and see which powerup fit with their playstyle the best. This combined with the two driver mechanic gave the player the ability to mix and match character combinations, adding a unique strategy that no other game in the series has come close to matching in my opinion.</p>
                    <p>Even when you ignore all the fancy gimmicks, Double Dash!! still has everything you'd want in a Mario Kart game. There is a certain charm to the simplistic, vibrant art direction that this game has that gives both it's characters and their environments a lot of life. It screams "Mario", and I love it. While it features a small number of just 16 tracks, each one is super fun to play and is geared to the games chaotic vibe. There may not be a large quantity, but there is certainly a level of quality that makes it so replaying these levels never get old. When it's all said and done, even though the series may objectively improve with each new entry, there are so many special things about Mario Kart: Double Dash!! that make this one of my all time favorite video games.</p>

                    <h2>The Sims 3 (2009)</h2>
                    <p>This day-to-day life simulation has a basic premise: live your life howwever you damn well please. OK, there's a little more to the game than that, but I think that once sentence sumarizes the game quite well. You take control of up to 8 "sims" that are completely customizable from their looks, to their outfits, and even their individual personality traits. Want to put yourself in the game and attempt to live your dream life? You sure can. Maybe you are a writer who wants to group a bunch of OCs in a house together? That is entirely possible! Or perhaps you want to make the ugliest abomination known to mankind with the worst personality traits the game has to offer and watch them suffer? Well, there's nothing stopping you, so go right ahead!</p>
                    <p>What makes The Sims 3 a standout entry for me is the sheer amount of content the game has to offer. There are plenty of jobs for you to get, ranging from the basics, such as Doctors and Law Inforcers, all the way to some wacky professions such as working as a Criminal or a Fortune Teller. Where the game truly shines though is when sims interact with one another. Again, there are a lot of options available to the player. You can talk about a wide variety of topics such as books, TV shows, how your day is going, so on. However, the personality traits of your sims will come into play during these interactions, creating some hilarious scenarios. For example, a sim with the Hot-Headed trait will be prone to getting angry fast and picking fights with other sims. Meanwhile, Flirty sims will start hitting on random strangers before you have the chance to stop them. While all games in The Sims series utilize this mechanic in some way, I feel like it was executed the best in The Sims 3 with the large selection of personality traits and interactions to choose from. This entry is far from perfect. It is filled with bugs and glitches making it a pain to play on some occassions. However, the core game is so good that I'm willing to put up with all of it's faults. It's the perfect game for me to just relax and play for hours on end without a care in the world. </p>

                    <h2>Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom (2003)</h2>
                    <p>Licensed video games have a bad reputation for being lazy, uninspired cash grabs that only sell well because of the franchise on the cover. However, Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom throws that narrative out the window as a timeless classic that still holds up with various other 3D platformers to this day. The plot is simple: Plankton invents a machine called the "Duplicatotron 3000" that will create an army of robots to help him steal the Krabby patty Formula. Unfortunately, due to an oversight, the robots fail to obey his commands, throwing him out of his lab and running amok. Naturally, Spongebob is tasked with defeating all of these robots and bringing peace back to Bikini Bottom.</p>
                    <p>The game is defined as a "Collectathon", where the player must perform certain tasks in an effort to obtain Golden Spatulas. Once the player gathers enough spatulas, they can move on to another area and progress into the game. The player switches control between three playable characters, all of which have their own special abilities. Spongebob uses bubble powers that give him a lot of versatile options for combat and solving puzzles. Then there's Patrick, who uses his strength to pick up objects and enemies to throw them around. Lastly, you have Sandy who utilizes her lasso to cross large gaps and grab enemies from afar. All three characters are distinct enough to have their own strengths and weaknesses, but not to the point where any of them feel unbalanced. The levels feature a mix of the most recognizable areas from the show, like Jellyfish Fields and Goo Lagoon, and some obscure locations that only appeared in an episode or two, such as Kelp Forest and Rock Bottom. Each level is filled to the brim with a variety of challenges the player can attempt featuring a solid mix of combat and puzzle solving. The writing is fantastic. Each cutscene has a level of humor that feels right out of the classic seasons of Spongebob. In some cases, it actually feels like your watching an episode of the show.</p>
                    <p>In fact, I think that sums up why I love this game so much. It's not just some platformer that happens to have Spongebob characters in it. The game FEELS like Spongebob. Everything from the dialogue, the visuals, and even in it's mechanics all fits right in with the spirit of the Spongebob world. You can feel the passion the developers had when making this game. If you're a fan of Spongebob and you are familiar with platformer games, I heavily encourage you to try this game out. It has aged extremely well and feels just as good to play today as it did back when I was a young boy playing video games for the first time.</p>
