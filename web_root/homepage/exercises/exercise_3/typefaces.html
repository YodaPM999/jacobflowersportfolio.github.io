        <p>Tschichold claimed that he was one of the <strong>most powerful influences on 20th century typography.</strong> There are few who would attempt to deny that statement.</p>

        <p>Between 1926 and 1929, he designed a <strong>“universal alphabet”</strong> to clean up the few multigraphs and non-phonetic spellings in the German language. For example, he devised brand new characters to replace the <strong>multigraphs</strong> ch and sch. His intentions were to change the spelling by systematically replacing eu with oi, w with v, and z with ts. Long vowels were indicated by a macron below them, though the umlaut was still above. The alphabet was presented in one typeface, which was sans-serif and without capital letters.</p>

        <p><strong>Typefaces</strong> Tschichold designed include: Transit (1931), Saskia (1931–1932), Zeus (1931), and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/sabon/">Sabon</a> (1966–1967), named after Jacques Sabon.</p>

        <p>Much like <strong>Arial</strong> and <strong>Times New Roman</strong>, which are supplied as core (or system) fonts in virtually all printers and computer operating systems, Sabon was designed to <strong>provide a font that would perform well and predictably across a variety of imaging technologies</strong>. However, Sabon’s creation <strong>predates digital imaging</strong>—it was drawn to satisfy the needs of <strong>metal typesetting</strong>. Thus, Sabon can be considered the first typeface to be commissioned as a “core font.”</p>

        <p>Designed by Jan Tschichold and jointly developed by <strong>Monotype</strong>, <strong>Linotype</strong> and <strong>Stempel</strong>, Sabon was intended to meet the common need for a typeface that would work consistently whether set in metal type through mechanical composition, or by hand composition as foundry type.</p>

        <p><strong>Garamond</strong> was the most popular text typeface at the time Sabon was drawn. While Sabon has been called a “modern” Garamond, this is somewhat misleading. Sabon is its own design, patterned loosely on specimen sheets of an early Frankfurt printer and type founder, <strong>Konrad Berner</strong>. The story is told that Berner married the widow of Jacques Sabon (hence the name) who brought some of Garamond’s original matrices to Frankfurt—thus the design similarity to Garamond.</p>

        <p>There are two general traditions of Garamond-derived designs: those based on the calligraphic shapes closest to Claude Garamond’s original work, and those with softer, more rounded forms. Tschichold achieved Sabon’s versatility by not emulating either style exclusively; instead, the design partakes of the best qualities of both. <strong>Subtle calligraphic overtones</strong> make Sabon resilient in less-than-ideal printing and reading conditions, and its <strong>generous lowercase x-height</strong> keeps the design reader-friendly while maintaining the grace and elegance of the original 16th century fonts.</p>

        <p>Sabon has been used successfully in just about every typographic application imaginable. Full counters, moderated contrast in stroke variance and relatively sturdy serifs add up to a design that is ideally suited to a wide variety of typesetting requirements.</p>

        <p>Tschichold considered Sabon to be his <strong>magnum opus</strong>, and it’s the only typeface he sought to be remembered by. And now, since Sabon has been translated into digital fonts, Tschichold’s achievement is also a <strong>modern Monotype masterwork</strong>.</p>
