            <h1>Design Rationale</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>Which Google fonts did you use and why?</strong><br>
            </p>
                The two typefaces I used were "RocknRoll One" and "Instrument Sans". Both had a friendly vibe that matched the theming of my website while still maintaining a strong level of legibility that is so vital for webpage designs.
            <p>
                <strong>Did you validate your HTML and CSS?</strong><br>
                Yes and everything was valid in the HTML except for the fact that I made the tragic mistake of forgetting to add an 'alt' attribute for all of my coin animations, meaning I had to go back and add that to each and every one of the 20+ links. It was annoying, but I can say with confidence that I definitely won't forget about it again in the future. In the CSS, I accidently added an extra % symbol to one of my measurements, which threw off a bunch of things and caused the validator to have a massive freak out over 10 lines. They were all resolved once I removed that one mistake.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Which compression method did you use for images?Â </strong><br>
                I used a combination of JPG, PNG, and GIF for my images. In order to retain their animation frames, the karts, coins, and background all had to be GIFs. The border images had to be PNGs because they needed to have transparent backgrounds in order to not cover up content when they stretched over my sections. Lastly, the photo of me is a JPG simply because I found no reason to change it from it's original file type.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Describe your overall objective in terms of design. What did you seek to convey?</strong><br>
                Since I talked in my "About Me" section about how I was inspired by various Super Mario artstyles growing up, I decided to treat this website as sort of a love letter to the series as a whole. I strived to make something that not only captured the Mario aesthethic, but the overall liveliness of the Mario games by making various aspects of the webpage feel "alive".
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How did you express your theme in this project?</strong><br>
                I expressed my theme by using lots of retro styled imagery from the old Mario games for a lot of the design elements in my webpage. For starters, all of my content is surrounded by border images featuring the iconic blocks and pipes. Next, I decided to take inspiration from the character selection screen in "Super Mario Kart" for my navigation bar, adding characters in go-karts spinning in unison and having the text reverse out when you hover over the links with your mouse, similar to how the cursor in Super Mario Kart functions when you navigate around the screen in that game. For the rest of the page, I added a little spinning coin GIF that appears when your cursor hovers over a link as a fun visual that also reinforces the lively theme I intended for when designing the page. To top everything off, the background features another animated GIF of pizelated clouds slowly moving left in a seamless loop, another design feature to make the website feel alive and, well, animated.
            <p>
                <strong>How have you used color?</strong><br>
                Seeing as I was basing this webpage on the Super Mario series, it was only natural for me to choose a bright, saturated color scheme for my design. Since the pipes and blocks are used frequently as border images, I decided to use green and orange as my two primary colors as they complemented the images I used quite nicely. The dull grey background seen on the navigation bar and on the image links was used mainly as a reference to Super Mario Kart's character select screen, but it also serves as a nice neutral color that really allows the vibrancy of the spinning characters to pop.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How did formal design elements help you realize your composition (scale, balance, hierarchy, positive and negative space, etc.)? Be specific.</strong><br>
                Scale definitely played a big factor when it came to organizing content on my webpage. As cool as all the fun animated images are, I had to be careful to keep them from being too big to the point where it distracted the viewer from everything else on the page, while at the same time making them prominent enough to grab your attention. I also had to be mindful of the negative space due to the animated clouds in the background. Again, it was about balance because as too much negative space made the clouds super prominent, overshadowing everything else and making it difficult to focus on the text.
