                <strong>How did you better organize content with your information architecture document?</strong><br>
                For starters, I wanted to organize everything in what I found to be the most logical order. I started with the "about" section to give the reader an idea of what Krazy Trompos is and what services they provide. I then put the "menu" section, which is divided into its own subcategories in order to keep the menu from being one massive wall of text. I put the "Location and Hours" at the end, because once the reader knows what Krazy Trompos has to offer, they're most likely going to want to know where their services are provided. "Catering" isn't placed on this page because I figured that would be on it's own seperate page given that it requires space for a form and such. Each section is placed on a large yellow bar in order to clearly define where they start.
            <p>
                <strong>How did you devise information hierarchy in your wireframes?</strong><br>
                I used proper scaling in order to clearly define the hierarchy. The main headers are placed on top of a large rectangle with a bold typeface. My subheaders use a thinner typeface, but one that is also still strong enough to signify something important. They also have a thick underline in order to seperate them from the other text that would be featured in the menu items. I sorted all of the menu text in a clear grid-like structure, framed at the top by images. Additional text and captions are placed in rectangles that isolate them from the background in order to keep them from getting lost or looking like they were just place there randomly.

                <strong>What two moods did you seek to convey in your mood boards and how are they appropriate for this client?</strong><br>
                The two moods I wanted to convey were "Approachable" and "Lively". My goal with the first one was to capture the welcoming and personable vibe I got from reading the text on their original website. The next one was also lighthearted, but a bit more zany. For a place called "Krazy Trompos", the webiste really lacked anything that screamed "crazy" to me. So this was my attempt to liven it up a bit.

                <strong>How is your logo appropriate and improved for this business?</strong><br>
                Like I mentioned before with my second mood board, I wanted to put the "Krazy" in Krazy Trompos. My little mascot of a trompo top gives off the vibe that this place is a casual and friendly restaraunt, while also portraying the fact that it serves Mexican food seeing as the mascot is wearing a sombrero.

                <strong>How did you make design decisions for your style tile?</strong><br>
                Seeing as how messy the original webpage looked, I wanted to prioritize organization and structure over everything else. I chose a complementary color scheme, clear and legible typefaces, and put some additional features, such as boxes and underlines, that would help keep things balanced and clearly defined. I also kept my casual vibe in mind and wanted to design the elements so that weren't overly intense or strong.

                <strong>What did you seek to convey for this business?</strong><br>
                A casual and friendly food truck business that serves mexican food.

                <strong>How have you used color?</strong><br>
                I tried to choose a color palette that felt approachable and laid back, but also not too dull at the same time. The reddish brown functions as the main color for the text. It's dark enough to where it goes well with many colors. It is also easy to read. The light tan color is used in the background. I didn't want the intensity of the default bright white color, so I aimed for something softer that would match the vibe of my business while also not competing too much with the content on the webpage. Lastly, I used red and yellow for other elements in the page to add some energy and assist the other colors in establishing a strong sense of hierarchy. I also used a slightly darker colored tan in some of the boxes in the "About" and "Location and Hours" sections in order to separate them from the background better.

                <strong>How has your design improved the webpage?</strong><br>
                All in all, the website has been cleaned up and is much more pleasant to look at with both its structure and its color palette. Everything is organized properly, and the reader can enjoy navigating the page without being distracted by all of the design flaws that existed in the original website.
