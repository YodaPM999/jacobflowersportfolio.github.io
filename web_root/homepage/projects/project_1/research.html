                <li><strong>What is good about the webpage?</strong><br>
                    Two strong aspects of this webpage that stood out to me were the high quality photography and the personable language used in the descriptions for the food items that give the place a friendly, laid back vibe.</li>
                <li><strong>What is bad about the webpage?</strong><br>
                    The text is crammed together and occassionally overlaps in some places. The red colored text not only varries slightly in tone, but is also jarring and visually unappealing. There is little sense of hierarchy. Everything just flows together, and not in a good way. Colors are inconsistent. At the top, we have pale pink, but the prices are bright red. Then there is this sudden neon blue colored background near the bottom which throws any semblance of consistency out of the window. Lastly, there is no navigation. Like I mentioned before, everything is jumbled together onto one page.</li>
                <li><strong>What is the biggest problem, as you see it?</strong><br>
                    Honestly, it's the lack of organization and structure. Everything from the text, to the layout, to the color palette, even the typefaces switch between serif and sans-serif and, in my opinion, do not mesh well together. Like one of my classmates said yesterday during the zoom meeting, this looks more like a mock-up made by a scammer than a webpage designed by a company.</li>
                <li><strong>Find a local restaurant or food truck page that is done well and provide a link to the site. What makes this design successful?</strong><br>
                    <a href="https://www.sourstreetpizza.com/">Sour Street Pizza</a> has a website that is very well done. The text is easy to read, the navigation is clear, the structure is organized and somewhat unique, and the colors contrast and compliment one another quite nicely. Sure, some parts go a bit over the top with the imagery, but overall, this webpage does a lot more right that it does wrong.</li>
                <li><strong>What are the goals for your redesign?</strong><br>
                    I want to both establish a strong sense of organization and hierarchy, while also capturing the personable vibe I got from reading their descriptions.</li>
                <li><strong>What is the desired action for a user?</strong><br>
                    To be able to navigate through the menu and get an idea on what each food item is and how much it would cost to order them. It should also be able to communicate the open hours and any other additional services on other pages if the user is interested.</li>
                <li><strong>Who is the target audience?</strong><br>
                    People who enjoy real Mexican food, from locals to foreigners.</li>
                <li><strong>List characteristics of a hypothetical user.</strong><br>
                    The users on this page are likely to be hungry, so finding the food options shouldn't be challenging. They also might be looking for services at a big event, like a birthday party, so the site shouldn't be a turn off. Lastly, they are most likely a big fan of mexican food, so the items being displayed in the images better do a good job showing off the quality of the food in order to entice the customer and keep them from exploring other options instead.</li>
                <li><strong>Ask someone who you know to interact with the site and record their observations.</strong><br>
                    I asked my mom to navigate the page and see what she thinks. Her first observation was that the food looks "really good" and how she wishes she could eat it. Her main critiques were that the text was difficult to read and that the site looks "unfinished" due to the lack of color and all of the empty space on the sides. She also thought it was strange that there were no other pages under the hamburger menu.</li>
                <li><strong>You may need to redesign the logo. What are your initial thoughts?</strong><br>
                    Maybe lean a little more into the "Krazy" part of the name? Right now, the logo is a simple shape of a trompo top. But nothing about it screams "Krazy" to me. Perhaps put a stick figure sitting on the top, who is now dizzy because the top he is sitting on is spinning so fast. Or maybe make the top a mascot by giving it a crazy characteristic, such as big bulging eyes or a large grin. </li>
