                <strong>What are the five different position values?</strong><br>
                The five different position values are static, relative, fixed, absolute, and sticky.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Which position do HTML elements have by default?</strong><br>
                HTML element are static by default.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Explain how position: relative; works.</strong><br>
                An element with position: relative; is one that is positioned relative to its normal position.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to what?</strong><br>
                An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport and will always stay in the same place even when the user scrolls up or down and zooms in and out.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>How is an element with position: absolute; positioned?</strong><br>
                An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to that of the nearest positioned ancestor. If there is no specified positioned ancestor, it uses the document body instead.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Does an element with fixed positioning scroll?</strong><br>
                No it does not.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>How does an element with position: sticky; work?</strong><br>
                An element with position: sticky; alternates between relative and fixed depending on the user's scroll position. It is positioned relative until the page is scrolled to a certain area of the viewport, where it will then toggle to position: fixed;
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>A sticky element toggles between which two positioning properties?</strong><br>
                A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Which property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others) when elements are overlapping?</strong><br>
                The Z-index property.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Which CSS property controls what happens to content that is too big to fit into an area?</strong><br>
                The overflow property.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Which overflow value creates a scrollbar in order to see the overflow content?</strong><br>
                The scroll property.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>What are the four float property values?</strong><br>

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Which property allows you to wrap text around an image?</strong><br>

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Which property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side?</strong><br>
                The clear property.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Explain the Clearfix Hack.</strong><br>

            <li>
                <strong>What is the major difference between display: inline; and display: inline-block;?</strong><br>
                The main difference is that display: inline-block can have it's width and height adjusted, while display: inline values can not be adjusted. Another key difference is that display: inline-block respects top and bottom margins or paddings, while display: inline does not.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>What is one common use of display: inline-block;?</strong><br>
                One common use for display: inline-block is displaying a list of items horizontally instead of displaying them vertically.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>How do you horizontally center a block element (like &lt;div&gt;)?</strong><br>

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>What are three ways to center an element vertically in CSS?</strong><br>
                Using padding for the top and bottom margins, making the line-height property value equal to that of the height property, and using the positioning and transform properties to align it yourself.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>What is a combinator?</strong><br>

                <strong>What are the four different combinators?</strong><br>

            <li>
